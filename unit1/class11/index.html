    - Methods
    - Objects as Strings
    
    ---
    
    ### Classes vs. Objects
    - What is a class? 
    - What is an object? 
    - What is the difference?
    
    ---
    
    ### Constructors
    - A constructor is a function that sets the initial state of an object.
    - What do we use to create the constructor?
    - Let us create a `Student` class as an example:
        - `student_id`
        - `first_name`
        - `last_name`
        - `birthdate`
        - what else?
    ---
    
    ### Methods
    - What's the difference between a method and a function?
    - Examples we have seen previously?
    - Continuing on with our `Student` example:
        - `get_first_name`
        - `get_last_name`
        - `add_grade`
        - `get_gpa`
        - what else?
    
    ---
    
    ### Objects as Strings
    
    - We have seen this before: dictionaries, tuples, lists
    - How should we print our example out?
    - What do we need to use to override the default print?
