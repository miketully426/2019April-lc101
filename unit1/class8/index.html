# Chapter 10 Lecture
## Lists

---

### Topics

- Methods
- Concatenation and Append
- Referencing
- Aliasing versus Cloning
- List Comprehensions

---

### Methods
- [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- We will see some examples later

---

### Concatenation and Append
- What's the difference between them on lists?

---

### Concatenation and Append
- Concatenation: Combines two lists into one NEW list
- .append() adds the parameter list to the list the method is called on.

```
#input
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.append(list2)

#output
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
---

### Referencing

- Lists are actually made up of references to other objects
- This causes us to have different ideas of equality: `==` and `is`
- How are these equalities different?

```
a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
c = a

print(a == b)
print(a is b)
print(a is c)
```
- What is the output?

---

<img alt="List references" src="../images/lists1.png" />

---

### Aliasing versus Cloning
- Aliasing creates a reference to the same list
- Cloning creates a copy of the list

```
a = [1,2,3]
b = a[:]
c = a

print(a is b)
print(a is c)
```
- What us the output?

---

<img alt="List references" src="../images/lists1.png" />

---
 
### List Comprehensions
- new_list = [< expression > for < item > in < list > < optional condition >]
- Given a list of numbers, make a new list of each odd numbers square.
- Example:
    - List given: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
    - List created: `[1,9,25]`
